       <p> It is eternal obligation towards humanity not to let them suffer from hunger when one has a chance of coming to
        his assistance. Each day, 25,000 people, including more than 10,000 children, die from hunger and related
        causes. Some 854 million people worldwide are estimated to be undernourished, and high food prices may drive
        another 100 million into poverty and hunger. Death due to hunger is one of the most brutal ways of dying. <br>
        <br>
        India’s hunger statistics are among the poorest in the world. India was ranked 102 out of 117 countries in the
        Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2019. As a comparison, India was ranked worse than Pakistan and Bangladesh. The
        absolute levels of hunger, particularly among children, are even more troubling. <br>
        <br>
        As the world suffered the coronavirus pandemic people have realized the importance of each other like never
        before. Many rich and powerful people like Sonu Sood and Kumar Vishwas came in front and tried to help out those
        who are in need but yet that’s not enough. Poverty is a big challenge for humanity and especially in our
        country, that no government can resolve the plight of poor all alone so we must do our part. <br>
        
        <br>
        Our website will provide the platform to those peoples, restaurants who wants to help and provide food to those
        who are in need. Whether its leftover or freshly made our website will try to connect people to various NGO’s
        who can provide that food to needy people. <br>

        <br>
        OBJECTIVE <br>
        <br>
        Our motive through this project is to establish a philanthropic system which can be used by anyone, whom is
        willing to create an altruistic world where everyone at the very least is not hungry.
        On our website people and various restaurants can come up and find the nearest NGOs whom can take the food and
        provide it to the ones who are in need.
        <br>
        Features provided: <br>
        <br>
        1. People & restaurants from all across the nation will be able to communicate to various nearest NGOs. <br>
       <br>
        2. Humanitarians will get to see all the NGOs registered on our platform so they’ll be able to provide the 
        amenities. <br>
        <br>
        3. NGOs will be able to see all humanitarians registered to our platform and they’ll be able to communicate with
        them via chat box or direct call. <br>
        <br>
        4. Philanthropists will have to put details about the amenities they’ll be providing so that NGOs will be able
        to manage them easily. <br>
        <br>
        5. Those who wants to provide funding will be able to do it through our platform’s payment gateway. <br>
        <br>
        Our platform is an effort to towards a small step to create a just world where every one is living in harmony
        and no has to suffer for basic living amenities. <br>
